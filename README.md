# Exploring Inertia.js with ReactJS

Welcome to my playground project where I’m diving into **Inertia.js** alongside **ReactJS**!

This repo is a space for me to experiment and learn how to build modern single-page applications without the complexity of a full SPA framework. I’m exploring:

- How Inertia.js enables seamless client-server communication  
- Integrating React components with server-side routing  
- Managing state and navigation with Inertia  
- Best practices and common patterns

This is a work-in-progress, so expect some rough edges and ongoing tweaks as I deepen my understanding.

If you’re also curious about Inertia or React, feel free to check it out or share your thoughts!
